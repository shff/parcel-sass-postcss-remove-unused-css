# parcel-sass-postcss-remove-unused-css

This is an example of an app using Parcel + SASS + postcss-remove-unused-css

Just fork and run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to see it working for yourself.

# The code:

 - [The package.json file, showing the configuration](https://github.com/shff/parcel-sass-postcss-remove-unused-css/blob/master/package.json)
 - [The original SASS file with a lot of unused selectors](https://github.com/shff/parcel-sass-postcss-remove-unused-css/blob/master/app/main.sass)
 - [The HTML file, using only `blue` and `strong` out of the SASS file](https://github.com/shff/parcel-sass-postcss-remove-unused-css/blob/master/app/index.html)
 - [The optimized CSS file in the dist folder](https://github.com/shff/parcel-sass-postcss-remove-unused-css/blob/master/dist/main.06d1150a.css)
